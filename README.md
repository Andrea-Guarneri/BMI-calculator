# Hi there! I'm Andrea Guarneri 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about **front-end development** and am currently focused on honing my skills in **JavaScript** through hands-on projects and exercises. Here, you’ll find a showcase of my journey in coding, problem-solving, and experimenting with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 💻 What I’m Currently Working On

I’m building a solid foundation in JavaScript by working on real-world solutions and adopting a professional approach to code. Below is one of the key projects I’m actively working on:

## 🏋️‍♂️ BMI Calculator 💪

**BMI Calculator** is a JavaScript application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided weight and height. It displays the BMI value, classification (Under Weight, Normal Weight, Over Weight, Obesity), and a corresponding image. The app features a responsive design using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with error handling for invalid inputs to enhance user experience.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **User Input**: Prompts users to enter their weight and height via `prompt()`.
- **Dynamic Calculation**: Calculates and displays the user's BMI, along with their classification and an appropriate image.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message and fallback image for invalid inputs.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design with utility-first classes.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updates the page's background color, image, and text based on the calculated BMI.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless layout across various screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Skills

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Writing modular, clean code while practicing key concepts.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Building structured, accessible, and responsive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizing utility-first CSS for efficient and rapid UI development.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically altering page elements and styles based on user interactions.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing user-friendly error messages and fallback designs.

Feel free to clone, explore, and provide feedback on any of my projects! Each one represents a step in my journey to becoming a skilled front-end developer.
